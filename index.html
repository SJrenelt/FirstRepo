  <h2> Introduction </h2>

  <p> I started college after taking two gaps years out of high school to gain job experience before college. This
    wasn't plan A, I originally was accepted and really to attend FIT in <i> South Korea </i> for their fashion design
    program, but couldn't get my student visa before the semester started because of COVID. I then was accepted to Pratt
    and attended for part of a semester for pattern design and realized it was way too expensive.<br/> <br/>
     I then worked in wardrobe for TV and film, and then went on to do contract positions in the fashion industry including working as a
    PR assistant for H&M and in fashion wholesale. I was extremely unhappy with the work I was doing in fashion
    wholesale and made a huge decision to go back to school. I took college classes in high school so I had enough
    credits to cover almost 4 semesters of transfer credits. <br/> <br/>
    Now, I'm graduating next fall from City Tech with my
    bachelor's in COMD. After graduation I plan to work for a few years while also attending graduate school to get my
    masters in biology. My end goal is to be a scientific illustrator and have my technical and vector illustrations in
    textbooks, field guides, advertisements, and informational materials. </p>
